    "Lets discuss one of the famous use case of B trees in databases. As you know that databases are used to store large dataset. The goal here is to not only store the data but also store it in such a way so that retrieval of data would be faster. \n",
    "\n",
    "One of the easiest approach is to save data in sequential fashion. The challenge here in this case is what if retrieval is required. Because data is stored sequentially the retrieval would be a costly operation because every element needs to be compared.   \n",
    "\n",
    "This is why we need a more efficient data structure to save the data that should help you in saving and fetching of the data. \n",
    "Obviously the data storage in B tree is not very much intuitive, it happens because there is a concept of key and associated value with it. The combo of key and value should be considered as payload. \n",

    "First, the database creates a unique random index (or primary key) for each of the given records and converts the relevant rows into a byte stream. Then, it stores each of the keys and record byte streams on a B tree. Here, the random index used as the key for indexing. The key and record byte stream is altogether known as Payload. The resulting B tree could be represented as follows.\n",

    "Each of these nodes in B-tree and B+tree is stored inside the Pages. Pages are fixed in size. Pages have a unique number starting from one. A page can be a reference to another page by using page number.
