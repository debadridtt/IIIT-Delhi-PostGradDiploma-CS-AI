The course consisted of the following modules:

i) Programming with Python

ii) Data Structures & Algorithms

iii) Design & Analysis of ALgorithms

iv) Databases - SQL & NoSQL

v) Machine Learning

vi) Advanced Machine Learning

vii) Deep Learning for AI

viii) Capstone Project

The course was taught by university professors and some industrial experts. It deep-dived into each of the concepts that helped me fill my gaps, as I belonged from a non-computer science background.

The projects were designed from the industry perspective and really helped me create a good portfolio. Not only that it also helped me understand the concepts in depth and improved my problem solving skills along with increment in my skillsets.

This repo consists of all the projects that I have completed during the course. Also, the marksheet of each module has been provided in the Readme inside each module folder
